# USEEIO API
This project contains versions of the USEEIO API in the 
[Go](https://golang.org/) and Python 3 languages, as well as a test suite. 
 However, the implementation in Go can be compiled to a single binary
file which is a full HTTP server that provides the data from one or more
input-output models and optionally static files. All data that is is stored in
files in a specific folder structure (see also the
[documentation of the file format](./doc/data_format.md)).
 
See the [Wiki](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO_API/wiki/) for instructions to build, test, deploy and use the USEEIO API.
